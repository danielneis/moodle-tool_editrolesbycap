Edit roles by capability tool

Created by the Open University, UK.

Install this plugin into the admin/tool folder, in a subfolder called
editrolesbycap. You can do that using git as

    git clone git://github.com/timhunt/moodle-tool_editrolesbycap.git admin/tool/editrolesbycap

You will get a new entry under Site administration -> Users -> Permissions that
lets you select a capability, and then edit the permission for that capability
in all role definition.
